<h2>Purpose of the app</h2>

<p>
  This app was developed by <strong>@Ajguerra28, @marianadkobayashi and @david2luis</strong> as a project to finish of the bootcamp from <strong>@lewagon.</strong>

  <i><strong>iBuddyfind</strong></i> is for people to find a companion for the various activities they want to perform. They no longer have to miss doing something for not having someone to do it with.
